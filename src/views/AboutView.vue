            This webapp is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vue, Pinia,
            Vue-Router, Vee-Validate, PWA, Firebase, Vite, Vitest, and hosted on
            Vercel.

            To provide a seamless user experience, I have added auth features
            using Firebase Authentication. Users can sign up or log in to their
            accounts to upload and listen to music, leave and sort comments on
            songs.
            <br />
            <br />
            For state management, I have used Pinia, a lightweight and fast
            state management library for Vue. It helps to manage the application
            state in a more organized and efficient way.
            <br />
            <br />
            To ensure a responsive design, I have utilized Tailwind CSS, a
            utility-first CSS framework. It enables me to create responsive
            designs quickly and efficiently by using pre-defined CSS classes.
            <!-- To ensure that the webapp can be used on mobile devices as well, I have
            made it a Progressive Web App (PWA). Users can easily add it to
            their home screens, and it functions like a native app. -->
            <br />
            <br />
            I have implemented internationalization using Vue-i18n to provide a
            better user experience to non-native English speakers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web apps, the webapp is
            built and served in development mode at lightning-fast speeds. To
            ensure the quality of the code, I have implemented automated testing
            using Vitest, a lightweight testing library for Vue.
            <br />
            <br />
            The webapp is hosted on Vercel, providing a fast and reliable
            hosting experience. Overall, Musicify is a great webapp for music
            lovers to upload, listen to, and interact with music while providing
            a smooth user experience, thanks to the various technologies used.
